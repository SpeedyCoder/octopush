        <p>
            The game is played by two teams of up to ten players, with six players
            in the water at one time and the others substituting continuously during play. 
            The object of the game is to manoeuvre the puck into your opponent's goal.
            At the start of each game the puck is placed in the middle of the pool and 
            the teams start on opposite walls. On the referee's signal the game begins.
            As soon as the game begins the teams will swim to the puck, the forwards 
            attempting to gain possession for their team. The team then work together to 
            try and score a goal while defending their own goal.
            Once a goal has been scored the puck is put back in the middle and the teams 
            return to their respective starting points and play commences as before.

                        The puck ("Squid") is approximately the size of an ice hockey 
                        puck but is made of plastic-coated lead or similar material, 
                        weighing about 1.3Kg. The puck's weight brings it to rest on 
                        the pool bottom, though it can be lifted in passes ("flicks").
