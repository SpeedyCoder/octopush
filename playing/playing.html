        <h3>Getting involved:</h3>

        <b>When can I play?</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                We are open to both members (students and staff) and non-members of the university!
            </li>
            <li>
                We run taster sessions at the beginning of Michaelmas (1st) Term, but new members are welcome throughout the year at our Iffley Road (Rosenblatt pool) sessions. If you want to come down to one of our sessions, don’t hesitate to get in contact with a 
                <a href="#committee">committee</a> member and we’ll show you the ropes!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Do I need anything?</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We can provide all the kit you’ll need to play, so all you’ll need is your normal swimming costume and towel (though obviously players who already own kit are encouraged to bring it!). You may also wish to bring a pair of socks to help with fin fitting.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>How much does it cost?</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In order to play at the Rosenblatt pool you must be a 
                <a href="http://www.sport.ox.ac.uk/membership/membership/" target="blank">member</a> of the pool - remember, if you are an Oxford University student, your college may well pay this for you!
            </li>
            <li>
                Club membership if £5 per term, which covers club and kit costs as well as the club’s membership to the
