        Oxford University Octopush Club was formed by two students, Christopher Taylor and Ian Lyszyk, in 2006, playing in Temple Cowley Pools.
        We are an informal club and have players with a large range of abilities, so you will be welcome whatever your experience.
        
        <h3>Tournaments</h3>
        Though a friendly club, we do also play competitively against other university teams as part of a thriving student octopush scene! The most prestigious and exciting tournament of the year is undoubtedly the student nationals competitions, which is held during spring, however we do also play in a number of smaller meets - including our very own Winter Kraken tournament!
