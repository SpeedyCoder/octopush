Both teams played 12 matches and each time had faced a new set of challenges. The Pirate team, under the excellent coaching of Keith, finished third in their competition. Keith, Adrian and Richard performed admirably, aided by the considerable skills of Ewan, Ferran, Sufyen and Arnaud. The Kraken team started off in an extremely difficult league and finished playing in the second tier, where they crushed some teams of very good standing. The Kraken team won all their games in the second competition, narrowly beating the Liverpudlians to finish ninth overall.'
