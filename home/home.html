                <p>Octopush (Underwater Hockey) is an exciting, 3-dimensional sport like none other you've played before. Two teams of 6 battle underwater to flick, push and manoeuvre a 1.2kg puck into their opponents' goal at the other end of the pool floor all while holding their breath.

              <h4>Student nationals</h4>
              <p>
                Sixteen members of the Oxford University UWH Kraken and Pirate teams made the trip to the Coventry International sports centre to play some of the very best university sides in the country. Both teams played 12 matches and each time had faced a new set of challenges. The Pirate team, under the excellent coaching of Keith, finished third in their competition. Keith, Adrian and Richard performed admirably, aided by the considerable skills of Ewan, Ferran, Sufyen and Arnaud. The Kraken team started off in an extremely difficult league and finished playing in the second tier, where they crushed some teams of very good standing. The Kraken team won all their games in the second competition, narrowly beating the Liverpudlians to finish ninth overall.
              </p>
              <h4>University colours</h4>
              <p>
                For their heroics at the student nationals, University players on the Kraken team (Lennard Lee, Joanna Collins, Piort Czaban, James Wilson, Harris Vince, Niels Martens, Tom Scott, Eleanor Mitchell and Jane Ellis) were awarded full Oxford University Colours and those on the Pirate Team (Robert Stanton, Ewan Flintham, Sufyen Buras-Stubbs and Ferran Brosa) were awarded half-colours.
